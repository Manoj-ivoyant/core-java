# 4. Collection Framework

In this repository, we explore the Java Collection Framework, which provides a pre-built architecture (API) for the efficient storage and manipulation of objects. Our coverage spans fundamental collection interfaces such as List, Set, and Map, and their various implementations, including ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet, HashMap, and TreeMap. We also focus on differentiating between these collection types and guiding you on choosing the most suitable one for your specific use case.
